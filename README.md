A Collaborative shopping application for Stony Brook students (or anyone for that matter!)

There's always a dilemma when you need to go out to shop. This is especially true for Stony Brook University students
who have limited time and limited spending power. This is a social app that allows one to find out through collaboration,
the cheapest price for an available product. This way, the students get to know the best prices for the product they want
to buy and allows them to save time and money. They can even view the best deals at a particular store that have been posted
by others physically present at the said store.
